# ESP Protocol Structure - Lee Eun-sook Configuration

> "AI must not remain a passive toolâ€”it must evolve into a dynamic co-agent, personalized, reflexive, and emotionally integrable."  
> â€” L. Eun-sook, Experimental Architect

## Overview

This repository documents the ESP Protocol, a structural prompt-based system designed to optimize GPT alignment through cyclical human-AI collaboration.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- Reflexive loop design for adaptive GPT responses  
- Emotionally-integrable architecture  
- Personalization without sacrificing generality  
- Exponential efficiency through structure-based interaction
